// Thank you for the guide
// All of the code presented is highly based on WebDevSimplified's version, I tried to do classes as a functional component but realized Class syntax is much better for handling state if dealing with Vanilla JS. 



// Still new to this, most likely did something wrong, please feel free to comment and point out some flaws and better solutions.
